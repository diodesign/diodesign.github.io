Code project importance
-----------------------

Code projects are listed by order of importance and then alphabetically. There are three standard importance levels:

high = most important, reserved for a few top projects
medium = next most important projects
normal = least important, ideal for dormant or trivial projects

(These levels must be in ascending alphabetical order, most important first.)
